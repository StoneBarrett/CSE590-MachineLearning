Overview:

 The blind test data contains a total of 90 unlabeled samples from the same Artworks dataset (64 extracted features). These samples were excluded from the data that were already provided with.
Your task is to predict the labels of these 90 samples using your best trained model.
Your submission will be evaluated based on its accuracy score.
You should submit a csv file with exactly 90 entries without a header row. Each of the entries (row) is your predicted label for that same row of features.

Submission instructions:

Have your best trained classifier ready (e.g., clf)
Load the provided blind test data by ignoring its header: X_b = pd.read_csv('blind_test_data.csv', header=None).values
After adding any needed preprocessing, feed the blind test data to your classiifer to generate its predictions: y_pred = clf.predict(X_b)
Save the predicted labels as a csv file and submit it. The file name should be: LastName_FirstName.csv: pd.DataFrame(y_pred).to_csv('LastName_FirstName.csv', index = None, header = None)
